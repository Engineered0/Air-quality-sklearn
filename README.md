# Air Quality Prediction Project

# Description
This project aims to predict air quality using various machine learning models. By leveraging a dataset that reflects different environmental factors affecting air quality, we apply multiple regression techniques to forecast air quality indices. The models used in this project include Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Classification, and Random Forest Method, enabling us to compare their performance and precision in predicting air quality.

Data
The dataset used in this project consists of various environmental factors known to affect air quality. (You should provide more details about your dataset here, including where it's from, what features it includes, and any preprocessing steps.)

# Models
This project explores the following machine learning models:

Multiple Linear Regression: Used to understand the relationship between multiple independent variables and the air quality index.
Support Vector Classification: Applied to categorize the air quality into different predefined levels.
Random Forest Method: A ensemble method used for regression tasks to improve prediction accuracy.
Results
The models were evaluated based on their precision scores, both on training and test datasets. (Include a brief summary of the results, indicating which model performed best according to your metrics.)
